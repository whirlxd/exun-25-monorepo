# Storyline

Twenty-four years ago, Nuxeland tried to erase a mistake it didn’t understand. Dr. Tai Ni’s breakthrough - *The Shrink* - sent his test subjects to microscopic scale, and the government responded with fear, bans, and silence. The shrunk disappeared into the catacombs beneath the capital; everyone assumed they died down there.

Over two decades, the shrunk built a parallel society called *etinuxE* - a micro‑civilization living inside vents, pipelines, structural cavities, and the hollow spaces the macro world never notices. At their size, the city above becomes a weapon: vibrations are explosions, water is a wall of force, and a dropped coin is a meteor strike. But they also discovered opportunity.

Unseen by cameras, unregistered by heat signatures, and untrackable by any macro technology, *etinuxE* became specialists in the one currency Nuxeland values most: influence. They:
- slip into casinos and nudge gambling odds by micrometers,
- sabotage political rivals and disrupt surveillance networks,
- tip elections with “accidental” malfunctions,
- make assassinations look like medical coincidences.

All of it funnels upward into one entity: the **NMIPC** (Nuxeland Micro Individual Protection Council). Publicly, NMIPC is a civic organization calling for legal recognition of micro‑citizens-constitutional reform, public polling, and the right for ordinary Nuxelanders to choose *The Shrink*, a right currently forbidden by law. They present themselves as champions of inclusion, transparency, and controlled pathways for miniaturization.

Privately, NMIPC is the political arm of *etinuxE*: a lobbying force with money, leverage, and microscopic reach into every hall of power. They negotiate, they pressure, they influence outcomes… and they never miss a vote. They operate on two scales: the microscopic world that executes the work, and the macroscopic world that signs the laws.
